Meeting logs for CSCI3308

# Tuesday, Sept 17
Team discussed severable viable project types, settled on  "ClassBook" (name maybe subject to change?). Most details ironed out, most of description written up.

# Tuesday, Sept 24
Finished details, Milestone 1 looking ready for submission. Small tasks settled for team members to complete at home, and submit.

# Tuesday, Oct 1
As a group, we decided to alter our framework to Node.js instead of Django. Although Jacob has experience in Django, we decided it was of
best interest to the group to use Node.js since that is what our assignments and labs will most likley be using. We also set up a Trello
page to keep track of TODO items for our project. 

We also started talking about how usable we want our app to be. Currently, our platform is useless if no one is on it. We decided we want
to be able to have our product be productive even if only you use it. We are shifting our focus from less of a social media site to more
of a tool. Degree auditing came up, and also statistics on the university came up. We really want our project to be usable for a single
person. The one we really liked was a class scheduler with instructer information baked in. The big problem is getting this data.

Another idea was discussed about alternative ideas, including a Twitter/other social media stats application to do analytics on a person's
account.

# Tuesday, Oct 8
The group discussed the usage of the application further and built the Trello up with prioritization of features and tasks. The group discussed approaches on designing and developing each of the features, and we believe it is in our best interest to work as a group through the list rather than independently take tasks for individuals. Otherwise, we are not certain that each of the features would work congruously.

# Tuesday, Oct 15
We have begun work on some of the base features and discussed our technical details. Jacob ran through the process of installation of software needed to work on the project on each of our respective machines. We are doing "tutorial" sessions to ensure that we all gain a little experience with the software and language features. We received the files containing the data on classes and the process of parsing data from the files collected has been mostly completed.

# Tuesday, Oct 22
While the team was unable to meet, we discussed some feature development and established another meeting date when we would be able to continue working and learning about Django. Some discussion about the backend details occurred, and we are deciding how to handle the interaction of the class and calendar.

# Friday, Oct 25
The team met for a while during recitation and shared features that were in progress, namely the profile page, a prototype class search, the beginning of a calendar page, and a home page. The project is starting to have a strong foundation.

# Tuesday, Oct 29
The framework of the calendar portion is beginning to take shape. We have decided to use the the Google calendar API because it is so versatile and appropriate for this kind of scheduling. The Google calendar API is very visually appealing and will hopefully add a sleek and modern feel to the project. Additional features like class searching are fairly functional, and a requirement for classes added to match a database class name has been mostly fleshed out.

# Tuesday, Nov 5
A lot of the project is coming together and approaching a semi-functional state and we have done some work for the upcoming milestone. We are planning to handle the documentation of the website architecture as well as the wireframe for some of the front end. Our API as mentioned previously will just be the Google calendar API.

# Tuesday, Nov 12
We met again in the engineering center as a group to continue working with Jacob in the Django architechure. Features that were being developed were improved to better work in unison and function cohesively. We are looking to get this website into a functional prototype phase.


# Tuesday, Nov 19
The team continued working in Django and making progress on the database formatting. Some of the features are functional, and FCQ ratings for professors are being utilized to produce overall ratings for professors. Weighting and usage of scores is being evaluated to determine how we can create a general rating for the professors. We have begun a pie chart break down for the classes a professor teaches, to show what departments they generally have lectures for. Populating the calendar with user class selection data is now underway.

# Monday, Dec 2
Today we met to finalize some small parts of the project. Today we also worked on making the final presentation which we will present on Friday. Our calendar feature is being finalized, while it is not essential to the functionality of the rest of the core features of our site.

# Friday, Dec 6
We meet about an hour before of final project presentation. During this meeting we finialized a couple pieces of our presentation and assigned speaking roles.
