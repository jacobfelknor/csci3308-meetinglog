Finished details, Milestone 1 looking ready for submission. Small tasks settled for team members to complete at home, and submit.

# Tuesday, Oct 1
As a group, we decided to alter our framework to Node.js instead of Django. Although Jacob has experience in Django, we decided it was of
best interest to the group to use Node.js since that is what our assignments and labs will most likley be using. We also set up a Trello
page to keep track of TODO items for our project.
